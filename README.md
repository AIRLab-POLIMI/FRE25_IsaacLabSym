# FRE25 IsaacLab Simulation

## Overview

This project explores end-to-end Reinforcement Learning for autonomous agricultural navigation, specifically targeting Task 1 of the Field Robot Event 2025 (FRE25). Using Politecnico di Milano's Rockerbot platform with its unique 4WIS4WID (4 Wheels Independent Steering 4 Wheels Independent Drive) kinematic configuration, the project implements a high-fidelity GPU-accelerated simulation environment in NVIDIA Isaac Lab.

**Project Goal:** Develop an RL policy that navigates crop rows by directly processing LIDAR sensor data and outputting control commands, without relying on traditional Sense-Plan-Act pipelines.

**Current Status:** Completed simulation development and curriculum level 4 training (Crab kinematic with command buffer control). The project successfully trains policies that navigate crop rows within ~2 minutes, achieving full row completion in ~1 hour of training.

**Keywords:** reinforcement learning, agricultural robotics, Isaac Lab, autonomous navigation, 4WIS4WID, PPO, sim-to-real

## Curriculum Learning Progression

The project follows a curriculum to progressively increase task difficulty:

1. **Level 5 (Current):** Plain navigation - Crab kinematics, automatic command buffer, skip 1 row
2. **Level 4:** Command buffer control - Crab kinematics, manual buffer control, skip 1 row ✓
3. **Level 3:** Multi-row skipping - Crab kinematics, manual buffer, skip up to 2 rows
4. **Level 2:** Full rigid body - FRBK kinematics with rotation, manual buffer
5. **Level 1 (Goal):** Full 4WIS4WID - Independent wheel control, complete task specification

**Progress:** Levels 5-4 completed. Level 4 trains to first row completion in ~2 minutes and full competence in ~1 hour.

---

## Training Results

After 339 training runs (487.29 hours total experimentation):

- **Simulation Performance:** Up to 3000 steps/second on GPU
- **Training Time:** ~1 hour from scratch to competent navigation
- **First Success:** First row completion in ~2 minutes of training
- **Configuration:** 4096 parallel environments, PPO with discrete actions
- **Observation Space:** 47 dimensions (steering, LIDAR, command buffer, past actions)
- **Action Space:** 3 discrete actions (steering, throttle, command step)

Key findings documented in `Multidisciplinary_Project_Report/executive_summary.tex`.

---

## Advanced Features

### Observation Space Composition
- Current steering angle: 1D
- LIDAR readings: 40D (configurable via `lidar_rays_per_robot`)
- Command buffer state: 3D (current command, parity, buffer state)
- Past actions: 3D (previous steering, throttle, command step)
- **Total:** 47D base observation space

### Action Space Design
Discrete MultiDiscrete space for stability and sample efficiency:
- **Steering:** {-1, 0, +1} (left, neutral, right)
- **Throttle:** {-1, 0, +1} (backward, stop, forward)
- **Command Step:** {0, 1} (hold, advance buffer)
- **Hidden States (optional):** {-1, +1}ⁿ for memory augmentation

### Memory Architecture
Novel accumulator-based approach avoiding RNN computational overhead:
- Differential hidden state control: $\dot{\vec{h}} \in \{-1, +1\}^{n_h}$
- Continuous integration: $\vec{h}_{t+1} = \vec{h}_t + \alpha \cdot \dot{\vec{h}}$
- Provides policy with "scratchpad" for state tracking
- Fully parallel implementation compatible with massive batching

## Development Tools

### VSCode IDE Setup
Run VSCode task `setup_python_env` (Ctrl+Shift+P → Tasks: Run Task) to configure Python paths for Omniverse extensions.

### Code Formatting
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Omniverse Extension (Optional)
Enable UI extension in Isaac Sim:
1. Add `source/` directory to Extensions search paths
2. Enable "FRE25_IsaacLabSym" under Third Party extensions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pylance Indexing Issues
Add extension path to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "/path/to/FRE25_IsaacLabSym/source/FRE25_IsaacLabSym"
    ]
}
```

### Memory Issues with Pylance
Exclude unused Omniverse packages in `.vscode/settings.json` under `python.analysis.extraPaths`.

### GPU Memory Errors
Reduce `num_envs` or adjust PhysX GPU memory settings in `fre25_isaaclabsym_env_cfg.py`:
```python
gpu_max_rigid_contact_count=2**23
gpu_collision_stack_size=2**28
```

### LIDAR Performance
Raymarching parameters can be tuned for performance vs accuracy:
- Reduce `lidar_rays_per_robot` for faster computation
- Adjust `lidar_max_steps` for raymarching precision
