# Agent-Controlled Command Buffer Stepping - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
The agent now controls when to advance the command buffer through a new binary action called `step_command`, replacing the previous automatic waypoint-based stepping mechanism.

## 📊 Changes Summary

### **Action Space Modifications**

**Previous:** 2 control actions + N hidden states
- Steering: 3 categories {-1, 0, 1}
- Throttle: 3 categories {-1, 0, 1}
- Hidden states: 3 categories each {-1, 0, 1}

**New:** 3 control actions + N hidden states
- Steering: 3 categories {-1, 0, 1}
- Throttle: 3 categories {-1, 0, 1}
- **Step Command: 2 categories {0, 1}** ← NEW!
- Hidden states: 3 categories each {-1, 0, 1}

**Action space is now:** `MultiDiscrete([3, 3, 2, 3, 3, ..., 3])`

---

### **Observation Space Modifications**

**Previous:** 44 base + (2 + N) past actions
**New:** 44 base + (3 + N) past actions

Observations now include the past `step_command` action along with steering and throttle.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. Rising Edge Detection
- Command buffer steps **only** on rising edge (0 → 1 transition)
- Prevents continuous stepping when agent holds action at 1
- Implemented via `past_step_command` buffer

```python
step_command = (step_command_action > 0.5).bool()
rising_edge = step_command & (~self.past_step_command)
if rising_edge.any():
    env_ids_to_step = torch.where(rising_edge)[0]
    self.commandBuffer.stepCommands(env_ids_to_step)
self.past_step_command = step_command
```

### 2. Mixed Discrete Action Handling
- Action 0 (steering): {0, 1, 2} → {-1, 0, +1}
- Action 1 (throttle): {0, 1, 2} → {-1, 0, +1}
- Action 2 (step_command): {0, 1} → {0, 1} (no conversion)
- Actions 3+ (hidden): {0, 1, 2} → {-1, 0, +1}

## 🎮 Agent Learning Challenge

### What the Agent Must Learn:
1. **Navigation:** Steer and throttle to follow waypoints
2. **Timing:** Decide **when** to advance the command buffer
3. **Coordination:** Step at appropriate moments (likely at waypoints)
4. **Temporal Reasoning:** Use hidden states to remember stepping state

### Expected Behavior:
- Agent should learn to step at waypoints (where previous system did automatically)
- Rising edge detection prevents spamming
- Reward signal guides optimal stepping timing

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify Action Space:**
   ```python
   print(env.action_space)  # Should show MultiDiscrete([3 3 2 3 3 ... 3])
   ```

2. **Monitor Step Command Usage:**
   - Use `--plotHiddenStates` flag to visualize when agent steps
   - Check if agent learns to step at waypoints

3. **Compare Learning Curves:**
   - Previous automatic stepping vs. agent-controlled
   - Monitor command buffer completion rate

4. **Debug Edge Detection:**
   - Add debug prints to verify rising edges are detected correctly

---

## 🚀 Training Command

```bash
./RUN_SB3_TRAIN_HYDRA.sh
```

With plotting during evaluation:
```bash
python scripts/sb3/play.py --task=FRE25-IsaacLabSym-Direct-v0 --plotHiddenStates
```

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

### Short Term:
- Agent may initially struggle with timing
- Command buffer completion rate may initially drop
- Agent needs to discover when to step

### Long Term:
- Agent should learn optimal stepping strategy
- May discover better timing than hardcoded waypoint-based approach
- Hidden states provide memory for stepping decisions

---

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

The play script includes fallback logic for old checkpoints:
- Tries `num_hidden_states` first
- Falls back to `num_hidden_accumulators` for old models
- Old models (2 control actions) won't work with new environment

**Note:** You'll need to retrain from scratch with the new action space.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Rising Edge is Critical:** Without it, agent could spam step commands
2. **Reward Engineering:** Consider adding rewards for:
   - Stepping at appropriate times
   - Completing command buffer efficiently
   - Penalties for premature stepping
3. **Exploration:** Agent needs sufficient exploration to discover stepping
4. **Hidden States:** With 8 hidden states, agent has memory for temporal reasoning
